    <h3>About Dogs</h3>
    <img src="images/dog3.png" class="float-sm-start imgHalfSize" alt="dog pic">
    <h4 class="paddingTopSides">The canis familiaris, or domestic dog, is a very social animal, and owning a dog can have many mutual benefits between both dog and owner. There have been many studies throughout the last couple of centuries citing not only social benefits of having a companion and reduced feelings of loneliness by adopting a dog, but even medical indicators such as <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.119.005554">reduced blood pressure and improved lipid profiles.</a> So if you have a dog, it is important to make sure that you care for your dog; be mindful of what you feed them, and provide enough opportunities for exercise. In this page, you will find more information about how to care for your pets throughout the various stages of their lives.</h4>

    <h3>Diet</h3>
    <h4 class="paddingTopSides">Throughout the lifespan of a dog, there should generally be fewer and fewer meals as your young one matures. First, they should start with being nursed for the first two months. Then, dogs should eat three meals per day when they are about 3–6 months years old, two meals per day when they are 6 months to one year old, and finally one meal per day after they reach one year old. Typically, somewhere between sixty and seventy percent of an adult dog's mass is water. <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips">ASPCA says</a> just a 10% decrease in body water can cause illness, and 15% loss can cause death!</h4>

                        <p class="card-text">Different dog breeds require different amounts of exercise throughout their lifetimes. A working-line German Shepherd, for example, needs far more exercise than a Chihuahua. As a general rule of thumb, you can multiply your puppy's age in months by 5 to figure out how many minutes of exercise your puppy needs, twice a day. For example:

                            <li>A <strong>2 month old</strong> puppy needs 2 x 5 minutes of exercise, 2 times per day. In other words, 10 minutes of exercise, twice a day.</li>
                            <li>A <strong>6 month old</strong> puppy needs 6 x 5, or 30 minutes of exercise 2 times a day.</li>

    <h3>Grooming and Handling</h3>
    <h4 class="paddingTopSides">Keeping your furry family member clean is important to the dog’s health. So be sure to brush frequently to reduce the amount of hair that sheds all over the place, and check for insects such as ticks and fleas. And bathe them once in a while! This in itself can be an exercise depending on how strong-willed the dog is. Do make sure though to get ALL of the soap out! If there is any residual soap, it can result in a rash (if the soap is a harsh soap or if the dog is potentially allergic to the chemicals) or matted and tangled fur that can prove to be extremely difficult to remove. As always, be careful how you handle your loved one. No matter the size of your dog, you need to be cautious as you carry your dog. If you have a small dog, then cradle the pup with one hand under the chest and the forearm supporting the back half. If it is a large dog, reach under the belly with both your arms perpendicular to the dog, and use each arm to support the chest and rear as you lift.</h4>

<div class="contentMid">
    <h3>Medication</h3>
    <h4 class="paddingTopSides">You should ALWAYS consult with your veterinarian, but there is a core set of vaccines that are typically recommended. Vaccines reduce the exposure risk to things such as hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus. Others may be determined by your vet depending on the environment in which the dog resides. Some of these include <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/vaccinations-your-pet">Bordetella bronchiseptica, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Leptospira bacteria.</a>
